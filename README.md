The goal of the Data Mining Project DineMine is to work on restaurant review data set from Yelp and mine
this data set to discover interesting and useful knowledge to help people make dining decisions, including
constructing a cuisine map to help people understand the landscape of different cuisines, mining popular 
dishes of a given cuisine, recommending (i.e., ranking) restaurants for a given dish, and predicting hygiene
of a restaurant.
I divieded project in different tasks:
1.Exploration of Data Set
2.Cousine clustering and Map Construction
3.Dish Reccognition

To perform each task I created a notebook each notebook also includes description about sub tasks.
